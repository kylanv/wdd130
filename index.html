        <p>Utah is a beautiful state with gorgeous mountian vistas, awesome ski resorts,
            and beautiful architecture. The state is located in the western portion of 
            the United States of America. It is home to many different Universities but
            at the forefront are BYU and The U. There is a great sports rivalry between the schools.
